							<h2>Hi, I'm Muhamad Arif Adiputra</h2>
							<p> 
							    I am someone who wants to be a software engineer since childhood. <br /><br /> Indeed, in the past, I only knew that I wanted to become a computer graduate without knowing the details,  but I always strive to achieve my dreams. I am someone who knows a lot both in terms of software and hardware and is still learning and following technological developments. <br /><br />
